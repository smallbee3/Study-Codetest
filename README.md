# A Few Tips For Coding Test
<br>

## Algorithm

### 1. Read carefully

You are not just coding. You are solving the problem that someone made to make afflict(?) me.\
So, I should be very careful when reading the problem explanation and sample data or code.

<br>



### 2. Do debugging

The earlier I start debugging, The faster I will finish solving the problem.\
So, do debugging always.

<br>



### 3. There is a hint in a problem

When you are stopped solving the problem, look at the explanation of the problem.\
There is a hint in the text explaining pass/fail condition.

<br>



### 4. Efficiency

Think about the efficiency of the code in the beginning if the test contains a large number of data.\
One tip is prefer hash table to list

<br>



### 5. Pseudo code (Step by step)

When you think, think as you write a pseudo code on the board\
This means separate the process, no matter how complex the problem is.

<br>



### 6. Simple example & variable

Make the example simpler.\
In the case of TestDome, the literals are not simple.\
For example, ["vanilla", "chocolate"], ["chocolate sauce"], "Eye of the tiger".\
So change these into simpler words.

e.g

["vanilla", "chocolate"], ["chocolate sauce"] -> ['ingred1', 'ingred2'], [sauce1, sauce2]

"Eye of the tiger" -> 'song1'

my_list -> arr

next_song -> node
