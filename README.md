# A Few Tips For Coding Test
<br>



## The Types Of Algorithm Problems


### 1. Complex or difficult explanation
There is no way except read carefully and repeat reading till you fully understand. \
You can search the internet for the words or concept you haven't known.

e.g. \
Roman numeric character \
Count() used in the problem \
...

<br>


### 2. Time limit issue
When facing 'time limit exceeded' issue, it can be solved with hash table in the most case. \
If it is not, then you have to make O notation smaller. \
e.g. O(n³) -> O(n²)  or  O(n²) -> O(n)

<br>


### 3. Many restrictions on the problem
To solve the each restriction, it takes quite a long time. \
And also, you can make mistake during pass the restriction. \
If you become so confused, then don't be. Because it is what problem seek after!

## Algorithm Tips

### 1. Read carefully

You are not just coding. You are solving the problem that someone made to make afflict(?) me.\
So, I should be very careful when reading the problem explanation and sample data or code.

<br>



### 2. Do debugging

The earlier I start debugging, The faster I will finish solving the problem.\
So, do debugging always.

<br>



### 3. There is a hint in a problem

When you are stopped solving the problem, look at the explanation of the problem.\
There is a hint in the text explaining pass/fail condition.

<br>



### 4. Efficiency

Think about the efficiency of the code in the beginning if the test contains a large number of data.\
One tip is prefer hash table to list

<br>



### 5. Pseudo code (Step by step)

When you think, think as you write a pseudo code on the board\
This means separate the process, no matter how complex the problem is.\
In different words, it can be said as 'divide and conquer algorithm'

<br>



### 6. Simple example & variable

Make the example simpler.\
In the case of TestDome, the literals are not simple.\
For example, ["vanilla", "chocolate"], ["chocolate sauce"], "Eye of the tiger".\
So change these into simpler words.

e.g

["vanilla", "chocolate"], ["chocolate sauce"] -> ['ingred1', 'ingred2'], [sauce1, sauce2]

"Eye of the tiger" -> 'song1'

my_list -> arr

next_song -> node
